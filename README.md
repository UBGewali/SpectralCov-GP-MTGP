# Gaussian Processes for Vegetation Parameter Estimation from Hyperspectral Data with Limited Ground Truth
This repository contains MATLAB code for vegetation paramter estimation from hyperspectral data using single/multi-task Gaussian process with covariance functions based on well-established spectral comparison metrics.

### Run demo code
#### GP with spectral covariance functions
```matlab
>> test_GP
```
#### Multitask GP with spectral covariance functions
```matlab
>> test_MTGP
```
